                <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world,<br>
                   is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. <br>
                   With a rich heritage and myriad attractions,<br>
                   the country is among the most popular tourist<br>
                   destinations in the world. It covers an area <br> 
                   of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the <br>
                   snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropicalM<br>
                   rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest <br>
                   country in the world, India stands apart from <br>
                   the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains<br>
                   and the sea, which give the country a distinct <br>
                   geographical entity.</p>
