        <center><b><h2>“Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident.”- A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h2></b></center>
        <p style="margin-left: 5px;">These words come from the man who knew excellence at close quarters, Late A.P.J Abdul Kalam. 
            The 11th President of India was a scientist turned politician who left a mark not just in 
            Indian but also in the world history. He has been honored with the Bharat Ratna, the highest 
            civilian honor an Indian can receive. He was elected the President unanimously by Bharatiya 
            Janata Party and opposition Indian National Congress in the year 2002. He served his term from 
            2002 to 2007 and then returned to his sacred life of education and science.
            Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career. He has been
            a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul 
            Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 1931 to a humble Tamil Muslim family. He had 
            to sell newspapers his his childhood in order to manage the finances of the family. He was an 
            average student in school but his keen interest in studies and his hard work are what helped him 
            achieve success in his career.</br>
         
            Kalam graduated in Physics from Tiruchirapalli’s St Joseph’s College, which was affiliated with 
            the University of Madras, in 1954. In the year 1955, Kalam pursued Aerospace Engineering from Madras 
            Institute of Technology. Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot for IAF but missed the opportunity 
            as there were only eight positions and Kalam qualified ninth.<br>

            Kalam’s journey to become the ‘missile man of India’ had its trials and tribulations and yet he attained
             his goal because of his singleminded devotion. After he completed his engineering, he joined DRDO’s 
             Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist. He also designed a helicopter for the Indian 
             Army in the beginning of his career. Kalam was still not sure of his career choice. In 1969, Kalam was 
             transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In ISRO, he headed the project of India’s 
             first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). The growth of Kalam began here from a mere scientist to become 
             the missile man of India itself. He headed several successful launches and started gaining recognition in 
             relevant circles.<br></p>

             <h2 style="margin-left: 5px;">A Tribute from India to Dr Kalam</h2>
             
             <p style="margin-left: 5px;">plans to pay a great tribute to late Shri APJ Abdul Kalam. The New Brahmos Hypersonic is to be named after 
                Dr Kalam. The missile will travel at the speed of 8,575 kmph and will have seven times the speed of Mach 7. 
                It is being developed by Indo Russian unit BrahMos Aerospace. There couldn’t be a greater tribute to a man 
                who has been responsible for such a progress in missile engineering in India.<br>
                Dr Kalam has been honored with the Padma Bhushan in 1981, Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and the Bharat Ratna in 1997. He has also been honored with National Space Society’s Von Braun Award in the year 2013. He has received honorary doctorates from 40 universities around the world. After his death, the Tamil Nadu Government has declared 15 October as Youth Renaissance Day. The United Nations Organisation has declared 15 October, Dr Kalam’s birthday, as World Student’s Day.<br>
                Dr Kalam was secular, rational, knowledgeable and a great inspiration for the future generations. He has given India a new identity. His achievements and research have attained him great acclaim. Being a bachelor, his entire dedication and devotion was towards his nation and his work. We need to learn these ideals from him and he will always remain a role model to future generations.

            <h2 style="margin-left: 5px;">Career as a scientist</h2>

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;">
                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]


Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][27] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[28] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[28] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[28] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[28] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[29] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[29] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[29][30]

Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][31] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[32] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[33] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[34]

In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".[35][36] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[37]
